 *
 * The user-font feature allows the cairo user to provide drawings for glyphs in
 * a font. This is most useful in implementing fonts in non-standard formats,
 * like SVG fonts and Flash fonts, but can also be used by games and other
 * application to draw "funky" fonts.
 *
 * To use user fonts, you must derive from this class and implement the virtual
 * functions below.  The only virtual function that absolutely must be
 * implemented is render_glyph().  You should make the constructor protected and
 * provide a factory function that returns a new object in a RefPtr since it is
 * a refcounted object
 *
 * @code
 * class MyUserFont : public UserFontFace {
 *
 * public:
 *   static Cairo::RefPtr<MyUserFont> create() {
 *     return Cairo::RefPtr<MyUserFont>(new MyUserFont);
 *

 *     // render the glyph into cr here
 *   }
 *
 *   MyUserFont() : UserFontFace() {
 *     // constructor implementation
 *   }
 * };
 * @endcode
 *
 * @warning
 * Because of a design flaw in cairomm, it is currently necessary to keep the
 * the UserFontFace object around until as long as you are rendering text with
 * the user font.  The following code illustrates the issue:
 *
 * @code
 * {
 *   Cairo::RefPtr<MyUserFont> face = MyUserFont::create();
 *   cr->set_font_face(face);
 * }  // scope for demonstration purposes
 *
 * // the following call will cause a crash because your user font is no longer
 * // in scope but it needs to call the virtual functions in face
 * cr->show_text("hello, world");
 * @endcode
 *
 * The preceding is obviously a very contrived example, but the important thing
 * to know is that you *must* cache all userfont objects yourself as long as you
 * intend to render text with that font.  A future release of cairomm will fix
 * this requirement, but that will require ABI-incompatible changes.
